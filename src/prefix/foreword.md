# Foreword

This is inspired by [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests), and I started to write this book to help you learn Rust with tests. The goal is to provide a practical and hands-on approach to learning Rust, focusing on TDD workflow to reinforce your understanding of the language.
